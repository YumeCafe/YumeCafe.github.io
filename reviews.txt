I'd like to thank Marcute for successfully rizzing my mom Aria so that the space time continuum may still allow for my existence in the future 10/10 #!#M1yaVT#!#Marcute<br>Aria
Time for a review! <br>Alright where to start.... it was a pleasant experience having fun with maid AnnaStarfire , Celestmia , and Boyney. <br><br>Anna being the kind and helpful maid she is feeding us with various items in the menu, also engaged in a very interesting conversations with me and Horou.<br>Maid Celestmia and Boyney are also fun to hangout with! We did some adventures of exploring the aquarium, treasure hunting the big spoon, and joke around with the other guests! <br><br>I rate my experience 10/10 with them! <br><br>However, I do need to note there is this 1 weird maid called Biscuit I believe, she go to our table with no introductions and just start telling us about some weird daughter situation about her being a grandma now (idk...) and also contemplating on kill 2 people that one of them is her own granddaughter? I am not sure what happened but thats pretty sus... ALSO she also like.... bring me an ice cream and only told me the cone is made out of plastic after I munched it, why you only tell that after I eat it? does she wanna poison me? <br><br>Anyways, would go back and recommend everyone to go back, just be careful with that one maid #!#Luxifinity#!#AnnaStarfire<br>Celestmia<br>Boyney
Pretty late review but me and WubWuv had the opportunity of having I.C as our maid ! had a fun time touring the place and got to see a lot of its bits and bobs while goin around, we also had side quests visiting the different tables as the paper inspection committee while looking for the elusive big spoon so an overall chaotic and fun time , would love to hang out with these two cuties agen #!#furuu + WubWuv #!#I.C
I apologize for the tardy review but jaygwynne, jeck1711, Fui and I had a absolutely lovely time with our maids I.C and Astral Cricket.<br>We had such a blast, summoning milk out of nowhere, commiting warcrimes, Jay getting stuck in the fridge... and oh so much death but also we had a very comfy time just hanging by the fire pit.<br>Also huge shoutouts to the best butler ever Jos- DoubleSchmo. I'm just joshing around, of course much love to the Schmo but of course JustJosh is the most Joshtastic, most Jovial and Jamazing warcriminal there is, inspiring the oh so most recommended item in the menu "The warcrime special" (note it may not appear on the actual menu).<br>If you enjoy having a nice cozy time or want to experience the chaos of maids and butlers murd- ahem having fun, I 100% reccomend at least visiting the Yume Maid Cafe once in your life and come out of it wanting more. 11/10 will always come back for more :3#!#Reddpal, Jaygwynne, Jeck1711, Fui#!#I.C<br>Astral Cricket
Loved how kind and sweet the guest butler was, and the whole maid cafe experience was amazing for my first time! The aquarium, food, and event special were highlights â€” 10/10, would love to come again! #!#sasayakanainori #!# Unknown Butler
What's unique on this visit is instead of being served with whatever we want, we have to earn the things we want by plundering "bargaining" the goods from other maids and guests. Overall we have a fun time doing this totally without injuries at all haha.. ha...<br>Anyways a very solid experience! 10/10 as always! #!#Luxifinity + Horou#!#Zetta
