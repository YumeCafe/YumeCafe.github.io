I'd like to thank Marcute for successfully rizzing my mom Aria so that the space time continuum may still allow for my existence in the future 10/10 #!#M1yaVT#!#Marcute<br>Aria
Time for a review! <br>Alright where to start.... it was a pleasant experience having fun with maid AnnaStarfire , Celestmia , and Boyney. <br><br>Anna being the kind and helpful maid she is feeding us with various items in the menu, also engaged in a very interesting conversations with me and Horou.<br>Maid Celestmia and Boyney are also fun to hangout with! We did some adventures of exploring the aquarium, treasure hunting the big spoon, and joke around with the other guests! <br><br>I rate my experience 10/10 with them! <br><br>However, I do need to note there is this 1 weird maid called Biscuit I believe, she go to our table with no introductions and just start telling us about some weird daughter situation about her being a grandma now (idk...) and also contemplating on kill 2 people that one of them is her own granddaughter? I am not sure what happened but thats pretty sus... ALSO she also like.... bring me an ice cream and only told me the cone is made out of plastic after I munched it, why you only tell that after I eat it? does she wanna poison me? <br><br>Anyways, would go back and recommend everyone to go back, just be careful with that one maid #!#Luxifinity#!#AnnaStarfire<br>Celestmia<br>Boyney
Pretty late review but me and WubWuv had the opportunity of having I.C as our maid ! had a fun time touring the place and got to see a lot of its bits and bobs while goin around, we also had side quests visiting the different tables as the paper inspection committee while looking for the elusive big spoon so an overall chaotic and fun time , would love to hang out with these two cuties agen #!#furuu + WubWuv #!#I.C
I apologize for the tardy review but jaygwynne, jeck1711, Fui and I had a absolutely lovely time with our maids I.C and Astral Cricket.<br>We had such a blast, summoning milk out of nowhere, commiting warcrimes, Jay getting stuck in the fridge... and oh so much death but also we had a very comfy time just hanging by the fire pit.<br>Also huge shoutouts to the best butler ever Jos- DoubleSchmo. I'm just joshing around, of course much love to the Schmo but of course JustJosh is the most Joshtastic, most Jovial and Jamazing warcriminal there is, inspiring the oh so most recommended item in the menu "The warcrime special" (note it may not appear on the actual menu).<br>If you enjoy having a nice cozy time or want to experience the chaos of maids and butlers murd- ahem having fun, I 100% reccomend at least visiting the Yume Maid Cafe once in your life and come out of it wanting more. 11/10 will always come back for more :3#!#Reddpal, Jaygwynne, Jeck1711, Fui#!#I.C<br>Astral Cricket
Loved how kind and sweet the guest butler was, and the whole maid cafe experience was amazing for my first time! The aquarium, food, and event special were highlights ‚Äî 10/10, would love to come again! #!#sasayakanainori #!# Unknown Butler
What's unique on this visit is instead of being served with whatever we want, we have to earn the things we want by plundering "bargaining" the goods from other maids and guests. Overall we have a fun time doing this totally without injuries at all haha.. ha...<br>Anyways a very solid experience! 10/10 as always! #!#Luxifinity + Horou#!#Zetta
What an awesome first experience! Thanks to Zetta and celery this was a perfect way to close the 'heavy' party weekend, Hope to see y'all next time. I'm sure to drop in üòâ #!#Johnny Dutch#!#Zetta
First timer here as well, and it was amazing despite mi anxiety and I wanna thank Biscuit and alexcrea (komae) for bein sociable and helping enjoy the event ^^ Hope to see everyone again and that everyone enjoyed the event as well! #!#Gasharshkomol #!#Biscuit<br>alexcrea
Absolutely loved the experience tonight!! Zetta and DaleOnTour were really kind and i felt very welcomed into the space! also had a banging time at the after party haha thanks to Johnny Dutch for bringing me along for the ride :VeryCool: looking forward to the next Sunday!#!#mortuaries#!#Zetta<br>DaleOnTour
I arrived not knowing what i will experience, but i was warmly welcomed, asigned two beautiful maids Zetta ShyShio which kept me entertained and fulfilled my deepest food DESIRES. They kept it extremely Profesional but fun. Had great evening.!#!#YeahNah#!#Zetta<br>ShyShio
First time visiting and it's a 100/10 for me! I was greeted with a warm welcome and tour around the cafe! Zetta and ShyShio are downright adorable and super fun maids that made it really awesome to be there! Definitely bringing my friends time!#!#Amateratsu#!#Zetta<br>ShyShio
Me and Horou yesterday got greeted by StarfallGlimmer! We spend the first half of the maid cafe session with a very engaging chit chat, talked about a lot of things including some very complicated relationships that the maids have. However, in the middle of it, the roles got reversed! Star was getting eepy and start to lie down on our laps. Now instead of the maid taking care of us, now we need to take care of Star! In normal circumstances this is unacceptable but, to be honest... Star was so cute eeping and after giving her a few headpats.... it kinda felt therapeutic, anyways! 10/10 would go back again!#!#Luxifinity + Horou#!#StarfallGlimmer
10000.43/10 maid sorry im really tired that's all I can say but it was so fun today ong#!#Ashuray#!#Decruns
It was my second day ever and my first without a group. I was vibing in the event and got paired with a lovely maid by the name of Astral Cricket, who really matched my flow. We were cuddled up talking and making little doodles. When we had more people added to the group she was able to make it so no one felt left out. At least, I didn't feel that way. 10/10#!#DarkNight5567#!#Astral Cricket
I got in a bit late, so i joined a group of my friends ( jaygwynne jeck1711 Neorg ) already attending, with I.C as our maid! It was a fun time for my first visit, albeit quite chaotic, though that's just the group dynamic. Next time i hope to join a bit earlier, maybe even with people i don't know or alone. The pictures you made and have sent are nice to see and appreciated! Looking forward to see everyone again soon!#!#TrashyPixl#!#I.C
Had the lovely honor of Evo Skorpion as my maid for the event. great time chit chatting. She protected me from Zetta (women are scary). Chatted with their group for a bit. I guess Biscuit got her group to bully my maid. Might have to talk to HR and get her fired for bullying. Got our revenge after with murder ended the event protecting the bridge with I.C and a bunch of others. Cant let JustJosh cross the bridge. 10/10 fun times#!#Horou#!#Evo Skorpion
Icecream Great maid. Very obedient. If i had one complaint it would be the biting. Id like a formal apology for that!#!#Sage#!#Icecream
Had the pleasure of being served by the delightful maids DaleOnTour and Astral Cricket. A splendid experience with lots of fun ‚Äî 10/10!#!#Sakura#!#DaleOnTour<br>Astral Cricket
