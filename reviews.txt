I'd like to thank Marcute for successfully rizzing my mom Aria so that the space time continuum may still allow for my existence in the future 10/10 #!# M1yaVT #!# Marcute<br>Aria
Time for a review! <br>Alright where to start.... it was a pleasant experience having fun with maid AnnaStarfire , Celestmia , and Boyney. <br><br>Anna being the kind and helpful maid she is feeding us with various items in the menu, also engaged in a very interesting conversations with me and Horou . <br><br>Maid Celestmia and Boyney are also fun to hangout with! We did some adventures of exploring the aquarium, treasure hunting the big spoon, and joke around with the other guests! <br><br>I rate my experience 10/10 with them! <br><br>However, I do need to note there is this 1 weird maid called Biscuit I believe, she go to our table with no introductions and just start telling us about some weird daughter situation about her being a grandma now (idk...) and also contemplating on kill 2 people that one of them is her own granddaughter? I am not sure what happened but thats pretty sus... ALSO she also like.... bring me an ice cream and only told me the cone is made out of plastic after I munched it, why you only tell that after I eat it? does she wanna poison me? <br><br>Anyways, would go back and recommend everyone to go back, just be careful with that one maid #!# Luxifinity #!# AnnaStarfire<br>Celestmia<br>Boyney
Pretty late review but me and WubWuv had the opportunity of having I.C as our maid ! had a fun time touring the place and got to see a lot of its bits and bobs while goin around, we also had side quests visiting the different tables as the paper inspection committee while looking for the elusive big spoon so an overall chaotic and fun time , would love to hang out with these two cuties agen #!# furuu & WubWuv #!# I.C
