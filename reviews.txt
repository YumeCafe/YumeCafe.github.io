I'd like to thank Marcute for successfully rizzing my mom Aria so that the space time continuum may still allow for my existence in the future 10/10 #!# M1yaVT #!# Marcute<br>Aria
Time for a review! <br>Alright where to start.... it was a pleasant experience having fun with maid AnnaStarfire , Celestmia , and Boyney. <br><br>Anna being the kind and helpful maid she is feeding us with various items in the menu, also engaged in a very interesting conversations with me and Horou . <br><br>Maid Celestmia and Boyney are also fun to hangout with! We did some adventures of exploring the aquarium, treasure hunting the big spoon, and joke around with the other guests! <br><br>I rate my experience 10/10 with them! <br><br>However, I do need to note there is this 1 weird maid called Biscuit I believe, she go to our table with no introductions and just start telling us about some weird daughter situation about her being a grandma now (idk...) and also contemplating on kill 2 people that one of them is her own granddaughter? I am not sure what happened but thats pretty sus... ALSO she also like.... bring me an ice cream and only told me the cone is made out of plastic after I munched it, why you only tell that after I eat it? does she wanna poison me? <br><br>Anyways, would go back and recommend everyone to go back, just be careful with that one maid #!# Luxifinity #!# AnnaStarfire<br>Celestmia<br>Boyney
